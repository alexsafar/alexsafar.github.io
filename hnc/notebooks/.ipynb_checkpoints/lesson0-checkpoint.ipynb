    "#### Basic Coding Ideas:\n",
    "* You can assign a value to a variable in the following way:\n",
    "```\n",
    "a = 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will give the variable `a` the value `3`, which can then be used in future calculations such as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(a + 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "which would return `6`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unlike many other programming languages such as Visual Basic, there is no need to declare variables to have a certain *type* in Python. Python will automatically figure out whether you are specifying an integer, a real number or a string (if it's in quotes). You can check the *type* of a variable with\n",
    "```\n",
    "type(a)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Variables can be named any combination of letters and numbers both lower case and upper case but must start with a letter. Python is case sensitive, so `A` is not the same as `a`!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Comments in Python are achieved with a `#` character. This means that anything written after the `#` in a line will be ignored. You should always write comments explaining what complicated lines do and write code in a coherent way. This is not exclusive to your code being readable by someone else either - if you write a code that is not properly commented and don’t look at it for a few months, you will not have any idea what it does the next time you look at it! This has happened to me so many times that I am determined to not let you make that mistake.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "print('Hello World') #This is a comment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Indentation** in Python is **crucial**. These two code pieces are not the same, and in fact the second one will give a syntax error:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for j in range(1,10):\n",
    "    print(j)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "for j in range(1,10):\n",
    "print(j)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "--------\n",
    "\n",
    "* If there is nothing else you take from this document, let the thing you learn be how to use **for loops** and **if statements**. These are central to most programs you will write during this course and usually play an important role in many other programs. The very simple example below illustrates what these statements do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for j in range(1,10):\n",
    "    print(j) #display j at each point in the loop\n",
    "\n",
    "for j in range(1,10):\n",
    "    if j == 5 or j == 7\n",
    "        print(j) # will only print 5 and 7\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "--------\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes:\n",
    "* To run a cell, press Shift+Enter or go to Cell -> Run Cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ask questions! Ask each other, ask me, ask Google. Read the error prompts - they are usually helpful!!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finally, there is more than one way to write a program! People have styles, as you’ll begin to see soon. If your program is different to mine then that’s not a problem - you will develop your own way of doing things, your own way of naming things and as long as you’re consistent with yourself then it won’t matter. Someone once described it to me as learning a language, but with an accent - we can all understand each other but we say things in a slightly different way! It’s like that with programming, don’t be worried if your program looks different - if the results are the same it won’t matter too much."
